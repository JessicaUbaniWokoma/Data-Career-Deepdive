## üß† Background

‚ú® As an aspiring data analyst, I often found myself wondering ‚Äî **what exactly should I focus on learning to land a high-paying and in-demand role?** With the explosion of tech tools and skills out there, it‚Äôs easy to feel overwhelmed. That‚Äôs what sparked the idea for this project. I wanted to use real data to guide my learning path and help others like me who are navigating the same journey. üí°

### ‚ùì Key Questions I Wanted to Answer
- **What are the top-paying data analyst roles?**  

- **What skills are most commonly required for those high-paying roles?**  
- **Which skills are in highest demand for data analyst positions?**  
- **Which skills offer the highest average salaries within the field?**  
- **Which skills are both high-paying *and* in high demand (optimal skills)?**

By answering these questions with data, I aimed to create a roadmap for what to prioritize ‚Äî not based on guesswork, but grounded in current industry trends üìä‚ú®.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

- **SQL**  
  Structured Query Language (SQL) was essential for querying the dataset. It enabled the extraction, filtering, and aggregation of job-related information to reveal trends in salaries and skill demand.

- **PostgreSQL**  
  PostgreSQL served as the database management system for storing and organizing the job postings. Its robust querying capabilities made it ideal for handling large datasets efficiently.

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**  
  VS Code provided an efficient development environment for writing and managing SQL queries. With the right extensions, it also allowed smooth interaction with the PostgreSQL database.

- **GitHub**  
  GitHub was used for version control and collaboration. It also serves as the platform for showcasing the project, making it accessible to others in the data community.

## üìä The Analysis

## 1.Top-Paying Roles for Data Analysts

To identify the top-paying roles within the data analytics field, I queried job postings where the role was "Data Analyst", the job location was remote ("Anywhere"), and the salary was specified. Using SQL on a PostgreSQL database, I sorted the roles by highest average annual salary and selected the top 10. This helped uncover the highest-earning job titles, companies, and their compensation figures from thousands of listings.

```sql
SELECT job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name as company_name
FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim on job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
```
### üîë Key Insights

The results reveal valuable patterns about the top-paying remote data analyst roles:

- **High Salary Range**: Remote data analyst roles offer competitive salaries, ranging from **$184,000** to **$650,000** annually. This highlights the strong demand for skilled data professionals.
